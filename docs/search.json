Are speaking of half of Lyle’s full time work week? Or half of his Crown time? It is not clear with this phrasing.\nRather, this statement is unambiguous with our shared understanding of FTE:\n\n37.5% of Lyle’s FTE is spent on MBV. He works 75% FTE at Crown.\n\nThe definition of FTE is strict; it always answers the question, “how much of a 40 hour work week is dedicated to the purpose?”"
